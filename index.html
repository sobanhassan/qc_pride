                <h2>STORIES</h2>
                <p>Quad Cities Pride in Memory is an oral history collaboration aimed at preserving the memories of LGBTQ+ Quad City seniors in the context of local & world events.  Using video and audio recordings, the project asks respondents to tell their own stories in their own words. The personalized nature of the interviews results in stories that are profound, offering insights into the living memories of seniors as they recount major milestones and daily routines.  Access to both video and audio recordings of oral histories is available here.</p>
