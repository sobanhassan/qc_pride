        <h2><strong>Our Challenge is to Preserve Stories and Educate People about LGBTQ+ History</strong></h2>
        <p>Our challenge is to document the stories and history of  LGBTQ+ people in the Quad Cities before they are lost. We are sharing these stories through this  website where oral histories will be accessible, along with supporting  materials such as educational panels, visual artifacts, and research projects  completed by Augustana students. This is  an opportunity to educate future generations and to create a more welcoming and  informed community. We have partnered  with Quad Citians Affirming Diversity, Augustana College, Putnam Museum,  Fourthwall Films, WVIK, QC Pride, Inc., The Project of the Quad Cities and One  Human Family QCA, and we will be working with the public libraries in all of  the Quad Cities.</p>
      <p><strong>The stories LGBTQ+ seniors have to tell are  amazing.</strong> They are powerful stories of marginalized identities finding community amidst  triumph and tragedy. The tragedy was all around them in societal persecution, discrimination and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The triumph was in the  fundamental changes in laws governing behavior, journeying toward acceptance  personally and in the larger society, as well as in the bonds formed between  diverse members of the community. Sharing the joys in these journeys helps all of us know how to move  forward toward creating a more just and inclusive society.</p>
      <p>In  the last three years, we have lost two special giants in the good work of  building community support for the LGBTQ+ community: Joyce Wiley (Founder of QCAD) and Clayton  Peterson (founder of We Care Weekends and an active participant in what is now  known as The Project of the Quad Cities). Their passing motivated a group of Quad Cities seniors to form a Pride  in Memory Steering Committee to start recording oral histories during the  pandemic. The Steering Committee has  gone forward with creating a series of historical panels telling the LGBTQ+  history of the Quad Cities and having them on display at local libraries and  other community venues. Historical  artifacts have also been collected for donation and display at the Putnam Museum. Augustana students, in a class on queer  theory, researched special topics on local LGBTQ+ history which is archived on  this website. Fourthwall Films has also  recorded key oral histories for inclusion in a documentary film on the local LGBTQ+ history in the Quad Cities. This  website is on ongoing project, anticipating the inclusion of additional oral  histories and artifacts as they become available.</p>
